# Stock-indicators
Useful functions that can be use for predicting the behaviour of stocks. I implemented them on python myself because I do not trust black boxes  

fsar is a function to calculate the parabolic SAR indicator  
frsi is a function to calculate the Relative Strength Index (RSI)  
fadx is a function to calculate the Average Directional Index (ADX)  

At the bottom of the file there are some tests commented
